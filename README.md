# MCP vs Direct vs CLI Benchmark

**Benchmarking three approaches to wiring tools into AI agents — so you can pick the right one.**

## The Question

When building AI agents, how should tools be connected to the LLM? MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the emerging standard for tool integration, but it introduces protocol overhead: server lifecycle, JSON-RPC serialization, and dynamic discovery. Is that overhead worth it when your tools run in the same process? This benchmark measures the concrete cost of each approach across latency, token usage, and end-to-end task completion.

## Three Approaches

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Spawns a server process, connects via stdio JSON-RPC, and discovers tools dynamically at runtime. This is the standard for cross-boundary tool communication — ideal when tools live in separate processes, machines, or are provided by third parties.

### Direct API (Pydantic)

In-process Python functions with Pydantic models for input validation. Tool schemas are generated from `model_json_schema()` and passed directly to the Anthropic API. Zero serialization overhead, zero process boundaries.

### CLI (subprocess)

Standalone Python scripts invoked via `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`. Each tool is an independently runnable script that accepts JSON on stdin and returns JSON on stdout. The agent shells out for every call.

## What We Measure

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Token overhead** | Size of tool definitions sent in each API request |
| **Per-call latency** | Wall-clock time from tool invocation to result |
| **End-to-end task time** | Total time to complete a multi-step agent task |
| **Total API tokens** | Input + output tokens consumed across the full task |

All three approaches execute the same task (file operations in a temp directory) with the same underlying tool implementations, so differences reflect pure integration overhead.

## Run It Yourself

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- Node.js (required by MCP server runtime)
- Anthropic API key

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/odedha/mcp-vs-direct-benchmark.git
cd mcp-vs-direct-benchmark

cp .env.example .env
# Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to .env

uv sync
```

### Run

```bash
uv run python -m src.benchmark
```

Results are printed to the terminal as a comparison table.

## Results

Results will be added after the first benchmark run. Run it yourself to see the numbers.

## When to Use What

| Approach | Use when... | Avoid when... |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **MCP** | Tools cross process/machine boundaries; third-party tool providers; marketplace/plugin scenarios; you need dynamic tool discovery | Tools are local to the agent process and you control them all |
| **Direct** | Tools run in the same process as the agent; you control all tool implementations; latency and token cost matter | You need to expose tools to external consumers or support a plugin model |
| **CLI** | Wrapping existing scripts or binaries; tools need to be independently testable from the terminal; polyglot toolchains | High-frequency tool calls where subprocess overhead adds up |
